# NICAR LCC Luncheon Code of Conduct

NICAR LCC Luncheon participants -- including paid staff, volunteers, speakers, and guests -- pledge to act in a respectful manner at all times during official conversation sessions.

LCC welcomes a diversity of perspectives about digital journalism. Participants pledge to display common courtesy and sensitivity towards anyone who comes to conversation sessions.

LCC is committed to active nonviolence in speech and action. Participants pledge to respectfully and peacefully resolve any disputes or disagreements.

Participants pledge to refrain from all forms of harassment. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion and spiritual belief systems, political views, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing or violent behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Participants violating these rules may be asked to temporarily leave the conversation space with the consensus of the organizers. If any participant or organizer believes that more serious measures are required, the organizers will meet to reach consensus on a course of action.

All such actions will be documented and publicly reported by the organizers. Such reports may omit identifying information provided an explanation for this choice is provided.

Organizers pledge to support victims and seek justice in all cases of violation of this code.

To report a violation of this code, participants should contact:

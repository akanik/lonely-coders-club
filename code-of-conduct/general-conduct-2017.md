# Lonely Coders Club Code of Conduct

## Off the Record
Everything said in the LCC slack group is off the record. You’re free to ask LCC members if they’d like to go on the record about a topic that was brought up in the group, but by default everything said is off the record.

Off the record means that you cannot use anything said in the Slack, whether on a public or private channel, in a public way outside of the Slack.

## No Scooping
One of the most valuable parts about the LCC slack group is the collaboration and open sharing that occurs between members. Members should feel free to come to the group with issues concerning unpublished projects without the fear that proprietary information will be co opted.

## Don’t be a Jerk
Skill sets vary among LCC members. This servers to enhance our discussions and extends our viewpoints. To keep this dynamic alive, it’s extremely important that respect reigns and no member acts like jerks toward other member.

## Also:
“Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Harassment includes, but is not limited to: deliberate intimidation; stalking; unwanted photography or recording; sustained or willful disruption of discussions; use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes; and unwelcome sexual attention.”
